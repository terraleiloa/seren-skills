## CSS Selectors Guide

To interact with web elements, you need CSS selectors. Common patterns:

- **By ID**: `#element-id` → `<div id="element-id">`
- **By Class**: `.class-name` → `<div class="class-name">`
- **By Tag**: `button` → `<button>`
- **By Attribute**: `[name="email"]` → `<input name="email">`
- **By Text**: `text=Submit` → Element containing "Submit"
- **Nested**: `form button.submit` → Submit button inside a form
- **Nth Child**: `li:nth-child(2)` → Second list item

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Navigate First
Before interacting with elements, navigate to the page:
```
playwright_navigate → wait → interact with elements
```

### 2. Use Specific Selectors
Prefer unique selectors (IDs) over generic ones:
- ✅ Good: `#login-button`
- ❌ Bad: `button` (might match multiple buttons)

### 3. Handle Dynamic Content
For pages with JavaScript rendering:
1. Navigate to page
2. Execute JavaScript to check if content loaded
3. Then interact with elements

### 4. Screenshots for Debugging
If automation fails, take a screenshot to see current page state

### 5. Respect robots.txt and Terms of Service
- Only scrape public data
- Check website's robots.txt
- Avoid overwhelming servers with requests
- Respect rate limits

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Website Monitoring
```
Check if a website changed:
- Navigate to site
- Extract content
- Compare to previous version
- Alert if different
```

### 2. Data Collection
```
Gather information from multiple pages:
- Navigate to listing page
- Extract item links
- For each link: navigate → extract data
- Compile results
```

### 3. Automated Testing
```
Test user workflows:
- Navigate to app
- Fill login form
- Click login button
- Verify dashboard loads
- Screenshot success state
```

### 4. Form Submission
```
Auto-fill repetitive forms:
- Navigate to form page
- Fill all fields
- Submit form
- Verify confirmation message
```

### 5. Content Archiving
```
Archive web pages:
- Navigate to page
- Take full-page screenshot
- Extract all text content
- Save for offline access
```

## Limitations

- **Same-origin only**: Cannot interact with cross-origin iframes
- **Authentication**: May require manual login for protected pages
- **CAPTCHAs**: Cannot solve CAPTCHAs (requires human interaction)
- **Dynamic sites**: Complex SPAs may need custom wait logic
- **Rate limiting**: Some sites may block automated access

## Troubleshooting

### Element Not Found
- Verify selector is correct (use browser DevTools)
- Check if page fully loaded
- Try more specific selector
- Screenshot page to see current state

### Navigation Failed
- Check URL is valid and accessible
- Verify network connection
- Try with different browser headers

### Script Execution Failed
- Verify JavaScript syntax
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure script doesn't reference undefined variables

## Examples in Chat

Here are examples of what users can ask:

✅ **Simple Tasks:**
- "Screenshot the homepage of example.com"
- "What's the title of the page at mysite.com?"
- "Click the 'Sign Up' button on app.com"

✅ **Data Extraction:**
- "Get all the prices from this product page: [URL]"
- "Extract the main headline from news.com"
- "List all links on the page"

✅ **Workflows:**
- "Search for 'climate change' on Wikipedia and screenshot the article"
- "Go to form.com, fill in the contact form with my info, and submit"
- "Navigate to dashboard.app.com and click on the Settings tab"

✅ **Monitoring:**
- "Check if the price on this product page changed: [URL]"
- "Screenshot the current state of status.service.com"
- "Extract the latest blog post title from blog.com"
