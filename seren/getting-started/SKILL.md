# Getting Started with Skills

## Overview
Skills extend your agent's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, and tool integrations. This guide will help you understand how to use skills effectively.

## How to Use Skills

### Finding and Adding Skills

1. **Browse Active Skills**
   - The skills panel shows skills currently active for your thread
   - Skills marked with a filled star (★) are active

2. **Search for Skills**
   - Type in the search box to find skills
   - Search shows both installed skills and marketplace skills
   - Active skills have a blue background and ● indicator

3. **Add a Skill to Your Thread**
   - While searching, click any skill to add it
   - The skill will become active for the current thread
   - Different threads can have different active skills

### Working with Active Skills

1. **Invoke a Skill**
   - Click an active skill in the default view (not searching) to invoke it
   - This starts the skill in your agent chat
   - Skills provide specialized capabilities when invoked

2. **Remove a Skill**
   - Hover over an active skill to see the × button
   - Click × to remove the skill from your thread
   - You can always add it back later by searching

### Creating Your Own Skills

Use the **Skill Creator** to build custom skills:

1. Click "Create New Skill" button in the skills panel
2. Skill Creator will activate and prompt you
3. Describe what you want your skill to do
4. Skill Creator will guide you through:
   - Defining the skill's purpose
   - Writing the skill content
   - Testing your skill
   - Publishing to your skill library

### Skill Creator Tips

- **Be specific** about what your skill should do
- **Include examples** of when to use the skill
- **Add tool integrations** if your skill needs to interact with APIs
- **Test thoroughly** before relying on the skill

### Thread-Specific Skills

Skills are managed per-thread, allowing you to:
- Have different skills active in different conversations
- Keep specialized skills only where needed
- Maintain clean, focused skill sets per project

### Best Practices

1. **Start small** - Activate only the skills you need
2. **Search first** - Check if a skill exists before creating a new one
3. **Use Skill Creator** - It helps ensure your skills are well-structured
4. **Remove unused skills** - Keep your active skills list manageable
