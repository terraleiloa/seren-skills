## ✅ Recently Completed

#### 1. Market Scanning ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Status:** Fully implemented

**What was added:**
- Integration with polymarket-data publisher via Seren MCP
- Fetches active markets with liquidity filtering (min $100)
- Extracts market data (question, token_id, price, volume, liquidity)
- Error handling for API failures

**Implementation:**
- `get_markets()` in polymarket_client.py calls polymarket-data publisher
- `scan_markets()` in agent.py wraps with error handling
- Filters markets by liquidity to focus on tradeable opportunities

---

#### 2. Order Placement ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Status:** Fully implemented via polymarket-trading-serenai publisher

**What was added:**
- Order placement via polymarket-trading-serenai Seren MCP publisher
- EIP-712 signing handled server-side by the publisher
- Simplified client-side code (no cryptography needed)
- Uses Polymarket API credentials for authentication

**Implementation:**
- `place_order()` calls polymarket-trading-serenai publisher with order params
- Publisher handles all EIP-712 signing, nonce management, and submission
- Credentials passed via headers (POLY_API_KEY, POLY_PASSPHRASE, POLY_ADDRESS)
- No client-side private key or signing library required

**Note:** The polymarket-trading-serenai MCP server abstracts away all cryptographic complexity

## ❌ Still Not Implemented

### Remaining Placeholders

#### 1. Polymarket Balance Checking ❌
**Status:** Placeholder code only

**What's needed:**
- Query blockchain for USDC balance
- Or call Polymarket API for balance
- Return actual balance in USDC

**Current workaround:**
- `get_balance()` calculates from positions (incorrect)
- Balance checks will be inaccurate

**Implementation priority:** MEDIUM

**Estimated effort:** 1-2 hours

**Implementation priority:** HIGH (required for trading)

**Estimated effort:** 4-6 hours (complex cryptography)

---

#### 4. Position Closing Logic ❌
**Status:** Not implemented

**What's needed:**
- Detect when to close positions (resolved markets, stop loss, etc.)
- Place closing orders
- Calculate realized P&L
- Update position tracker

**Current workaround:**
- Positions never close automatically
- User must close manually via Polymarket UI

**Implementation priority:** MEDIUM

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours

---

#### 5. Seren-Cron Integration ❌
**Status:** Client code exists, but no automation setup

**What's needed:**
- Web endpoint that triggers `agent.py`
- Or alternative: system cron + shell script
- Proper error handling for automated runs

**Current workaround:**
- User must run `python agent.py` manually
- No autonomous operation yet

**Implementation priority:** LOW (nice to have)

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours

### Learning & Performance Tracking ✅ **NEW**

#### Prediction Accuracy Tracking ✅
- **Status:** Fully implemented
- Tracks all fair value predictions to database
- Records market conditions at time of prediction
- Updates with actual outcomes when markets resolve

#### Brier Score & Calibration Metrics ✅
- **Status:** Fully implemented
- Calculates industry-standard Brier score for probabilistic forecasts
- Generates calibration curves (predicted vs actual by probability bucket)
- Linear regression analysis for calibration slope/intercept
- Stored in SerenDB for historical tracking

#### Performance-Based Threshold Adjustment ✅
- **Status:** Fully implemented
- Dynamically adjusts Kelly multiplier based on historical accuracy
- Adjusts edge threshold based on calibration and P&L
- Logic considers:
  - Brier score (prediction quality)
  - Calibration slope (over/underconfidence)
  - ROI (financial performance)
- Safe min/max bounds prevent extreme adjustments

#### Win/Loss Tracking on Resolved Markets ✅
- **Status:** Fully implemented
- Tracks all market resolutions with outcomes
- Records realized P&L when positions close
- Calculates win rate, avg win, avg loss, profit factor
- ROI percentage tracking per trade

#### Database Schema ✅
- **predictions** table: All fair value estimates with outcomes
- **performance_metrics** table: Aggregate statistics over time
- **resolved_markets** table: P&L tracking for closed positions
- All data stored in user's SerenDB instance (cloud-based)

#### Performance Module ✅
- **performance.py**: Standalone module with:
  - `calculate_brier_score()`
  - `calculate_calibration_curve()`
  - `adjust_kelly_multiplier()`
  - `adjust_edge_threshold()`
  - `calculate_win_rate()`
  - `summarize_performance()`

## 🔧 How to Help Complete This

### For Market Scanning
The polymarket-data publisher exists. Need to:
1. Call `mcp__seren-mcp__get_agent_publisher` with slug 'polymarket-data'
2. Examine available endpoints
3. Implement `scan_markets()` to fetch active markets
4. Parse response into market dicts with required fields

### For EIP-712 Signing
The py-clob-client package may already handle this:
1. Review py-clob-client documentation
2. Use their order signing utilities
3. Replace simplified `place_order()` with proper signing
4. Test with small amounts first

### For Testing
1. Create `.env` with real API keys (for testing only)
2. Fund Seren wallet with small amount ($5-10)
3. Create test Polymarket account with minimal USDC
4. Run dry-run mode to verify research/estimation
5. Test live trading with $1 positions

## 📊 Implementation Completeness

**Core Logic:** 90% ✅
- Position sizing: ✅
- Fair value estimation: ✅
- Trade evaluation: ✅
- Logging: ✅
- Configuration: ✅

**Integration:** 40% ⚠️
- Seren API client: ✅
- Polymarket client: 🟡 (needs signing)
- Market data: ❌
- Balance checking: ❌

**Production Ready:** 30% ❌
- Error handling: 🟡 (basic)
- Monitoring: 🟡 (logs only)
- Testing: ❌
- Security: 🟡 (credentials via env)
- Documentation: ✅

**Overall:** **60% Complete**

The foundation is solid. The remaining 40% is primarily integration work (market scanning, order signing) and production hardening (testing, monitoring, error handling).

## 🎯 Realistic Expectations

### What Works NOW:
- Configuration and credential management
- Position sizing calculations (Kelly Criterion)
- Logging framework
- Dry-run mode (but finds no markets)

### What Works SOON (1-2 days work):
- Market scanning
- Order placement
- Basic trading loop

### What Works LATER (1 week work):
- Position closing
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Web dashboard
- Backtesting

### What's Production-Ready:
- Documentation
- Legal disclaimers
- Risk management logic
- Architecture design

**Bottom Line:** The bot is well-designed and 60% implemented. The core trading logic is solid. The missing 40% is primarily plumbing (APIs, signing, scanning) that requires access to actual Polymarket APIs to implement and test.
